$\mathbf{x} = \left\{ X_1, \dots, X_k \right\}^{\prime}$
is a vector of random variables,
$\boldsymbol{\mu}$ is a $k \times 1$
vector of means of the random variables,

$\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ is a $k \times k$
matrix of variances on the diagonals
and covariances on the off-diagonals
of the random variables.
