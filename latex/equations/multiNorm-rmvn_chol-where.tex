$\mathbf{Z}$
is an
$n \times k$ matrix of random variates
from the standard normal distribution,
$\mathbf{Q}$
is the upper triangular factor
of the Cholesky decomposition
given by
$\boldsymbol{\Sigma} = \mathbf{Q}^{\prime} \mathbf{Q}$
where $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ is the covariance matrix,
$1_n$ is an $n \times 1$ column vector of ones,
and $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ is the mean vector.
